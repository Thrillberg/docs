title: What&#39;s New in v20.2.0-beta.1
toc: true
summary: Additions and changes in CockroachDB version v20.2.0-beta.1 since version v20.2.0-alpha.3
---

## August 31, 2020

In addition to various updates, enhancements, and bug fixes, this first v20.2 beta release includes the following major highlights:

- **Backup schedules:** You can now schedule backups natively in CockroachDB. Previously, it was necessary to create your own scheduler service or cron job to kick off [`BACKUP`](../v20.2/backup.html) jobs. You can now set up a recurring schedule that lets CockroachDB handle scheduling, conflict resolution, and resilience for your backups. To create a schedule for a cluster-level backup that runs a full backup every day with the first full backup taken "now", run `CREATE SCHEDULE test_backup_schedule FOR BACKUP INTO ‘<your-backup-storage-location’ RECURRING ‘@daily’ FULL BACKUP ALWAYS WITH EXPERIMENTAL SCHEDULE OPTIONS first_run=NOW`.
- The following SQL features improve CockroachDB's PostgreSQL compatibility:
  - **User-defined schemas:** Within a given database, you can now create schemas to organize your data and create finer-grained access controls. To enable user-defined schemas, set the [cluster setting](../v20.2/cluster-settings.html) `sql.defaults.experimental_user_defined_schemas.enabled` to `true`. Previously, the recommendation was to create a database wherever you would normally create a schema. Now, an existing database can be converted to a schema under an existing database using [`ALTER DATABASE ... CONVERT TO SCHEMA WITH PARENT ...`](../v20.2/alter-database.html).
  - **Enums:** `ENUM` [types](../v20.2/data-types.html) can now be created in CockroachDB using `CREATE TYPE ... AS ENUM`. To create enums, set the [cluster setting](../v20.2/cluster-settings.html) `sql.defaults.experimental_enums.enabled` to `true`. A column type can be set to an `ENUM` type, which limits the column values to those defined in the `ENUM`.

### Backward-incompatible changes

- A change to the on-disk representation for user-defined schemas, enums, and databases was made that is backward-incompatible with 20.2 alpha releases. Only schemas, enums, and databases in the middle of being dropped at the time of the upgrade are affected, and the upgrade may result in the drop never running to completion. If you are upgrading from a 20.2 alpha release to a 20.2 beta release, we advise that you avoid dropping schemas, enums and databases. [#53387][#53387]

### Security updates

- Certificate revocation is now supported via OSCP and the [cluster setting](../v20.2/cluster-settings.html) `security.ocsp.mode`. This makes a call to the OCSP server on every connection attempt and may wait for up to value specified with the setting `security.ocsp.timeout`. [#53218][#53218]
- Defining or changing [authentication](../v20.2/authorization.html) principals or their credentials now requires the new `CREATELOGIN` option to be set for the requesting user or one of its roles. This includes setting/removing the LOGIN option (whether the principal can log in), initializing or changing the password of a SQL user, and setting the expiration date for a password. Previously, only the `CREATEROLE` option could perform these changes. The pseudo-option `NOCREATELOGIN` can be used to revoke `CREATELOGIN`. The two predefined `root` and `admin` [roles](../v20.2/authorization.html#default-roles) have the option `CREATELOGIN` set by default. [#50601][#50601]
- Only a user which already has the `CREATELOGIN` option (either itself or one of its roles) can grant this option or use `NOCREATELOGIN`. [#50601][#50601]
- Roles that had the `CREATEROLE` privilege prior to upgrading to this version are also automatically granted `CREATELOGIN`. After the upgrade, `CREATELOGIN` is no longer granted automatically. [#50601][#50601]

### General changes

- `Random()` and `gen_random_uuid()` are now supported as default expressions for [`IMPORT`](../v20.2/import.html). [#52247][#52247]
- [`IMPORT INTO`](../v20.2/import-into.html) is now supported for `DELIMITED` and `PGCOPY` file formats. [#52628][#52628]
- Computed columns are now supported in the [`IMPORT INTO`](../v20.2/import-into.html) operation. [#51321][#51321]
- As part of the transition to 20.2, the migration to upgrade schema change jobs started prior to 20.1 is no longer run. [#52968][#52968]
- In some cases where `AmbiguousResultErrors` were produced under high load, non-ambiguous, retriable errors are now returned. [#53156][#53156]

### Enterprise edition changes

- [`SHOW BACKUP`](../v20.2/show-backup.html) can be used to list backups in a backup collection created by `BACKUP ... INTO`. [#52758][#52758]
- [`BACKUP`](../v20.2/backup.html)s with `revision_history` now support including UDTs. [#53160][#53160]
- User-defined schemas now support being backed up with revision history and restored with `AS OF SYSTEM TIME`. [#53241][#53241]
- Scheduled jobs are now included in [cluster backups](../v20.2/backup#backup-a-cluster). [#53203][#53203]
- As part of making basic [`BACKUP`](../v20.2/backup.html) and [`RESTORE`](../v20.2/restore.html) free to use without an enterprise license, [`SHOW BACKUP`](../v20.2/show-backup.html) and `SHOW BACKUPS IN` no longer require a license. [#53356][#53356]

### SQL language changes

- Reduced memory used by scans of tables containing JSON data. [#52738][#52738]
- Introduced the `box2d` [data type](../v20.2/data-types.html) to be used for geospatial comparators with [`GEOMETRY`/`GEOGRAPHY`](../v20.2/spatial-data.html). [#52771][#52771]
- [`EXPLAIN`](../v20.2/explain.html) now shows estimated row count for scans (when statistics are available). [`EXPLAIN (VERBOSE)`](../v20.2/explain.html) now shows the estimated row count for all operators. [#52798][#52798]
- Implemented geometry [builtin](../v20.2/functions-and-operators.html#built-in-functions) `ST_Reverse` [#52834][#52834]
- Implemented the `&&` and `~` operators for comparing bounding box objects and geometries. [#52913][#52913]
- Added support for `ALTER TABLE <table> OWNER TO <owner>`. The command changes the owner of a table. To use the conditions, the following conditions must be met: The user executing the command must be the owner of the table, or the member of the owner role. The user executing the command must be a member of the new owner role. The new owner role must have `CREATE` on the schema the table belongs to. [#52659][#52659]
- Implemented the `ST_CombineBBox` [builtin](../v20.2/functions-and-operators.html#built-in-functions). [#52903][#52903]
- Introduced the `s2_max_level`, `s2_level_mod`, and `s2_max_cells` storage parameters for modifying the S2 parameters for indexing [`GEOMETRY` and `GEOGRAPHY`](../v20.2/spatial-data.html) data types in an inverted index. [#52800][#52800]
- Introduced the `geometry_min_x`, `geometry_min_y`, `geometry_max_x`, `geometry_max_y` storage parameters for indexing GEOMETRY data types in an inverted index. [#52800][#52800]
- Implemented the `ALTER MATERIALIZED VIEW` and `DROP MATERIALIZED VIEW` commands. [#52840][#52840]
- Added support for `SELECT ... FOR {UPDATE,SHARE} NOWAIT`. The option can be used to throw an error instead of blocking on contended row-level lock acquisition. [#52522][#52522]
- Implemented the ability to cast between `box2d` and `GEOMETRY` types. [#52965][#52965]
- Implemented the `PostGIS_GetBBox` [builtin](../v20.2/functions-and-operators.html#built-in-functions). [#52963][#52963]
- Implemented the `ST_MakeBox2D` [builtin](../v20.2/functions-and-operators.html#built-in-functions). [#52961][#52961]
- Implemented the `ST_ClipByBox2D` [builtin](../v20.2/functions-and-operators.html#built-in-functions). [#52955][#52955]
- Added the ability to resolve the spatial-backed [builtins](../v20.2/functions-and-operators.html#built-in-functions) in the public schema. For example, `public.st_x` works the same as `st_x`. [#52983][#52983]
- Implemented `ST_Expand` for the `box2d` type. [#52957][#52957]
- Added privileges to user-defined types. Users can grant privileges on a type by using [`GRANT {USAGE/GRANT/ALL} ON TYPE <type> TO <users>`](../v20.2/grant.html). Users must have `CREATE` privilege in a database to create a type in that database. Users must have `USAGE` privilege to create an object that depends on a type. Users must have `GRANT` privilege to grant more privileges on the type. Owning a type implicitly gives ALL privileges on the type (`USAGE`,`GRANT`). Users must be the owner of the type to drop the type. Users must be the owner of the type to alter the type. After creating a type, the creator can delegate privileges on that type by [`GRANT`](../v20.2/grant.html)ing any of the `USAGE`/`GRANT`/`ALL` privileges. To allow another user to grant privileges, they must have `GRANT` privilege and the privilege they want to [`GRANT`](../v20.2/grant.html). [#51622][#51622]
- [`EXPLAIN`](../v20.2/explain.html) now shows fewer "project" nodes. [#52865][#52865]
- Improved display of spans in [`EXPLAIN`](../v20.2/explain.html). [#52865][#52865]
- Added support for the `DROP SCHEMA` command. [#52726][#52726]
- Adds a new [cluster setting](../v20.2/cluster-settings.html) `sql.log.slow_query.internal` which, when turned on in conjunction with the [slow query log](../v20.2/query-behavior-troubleshooting.html#using-the-slow-query-log), causes slow internal queries to be logged to a slow internal query log at `cockroach-sql-slow-internal-only.log`. Internal queries are no longer logged to the slow query log. This new setting is opt-in. The default behavior is to not log slow internal queries. [#52377][#52377]
- Removed some unnecessary [`EXPLAIN`](../v20.2/explain.html) fields, and relegated others to the `VERBOSE` variant. [#53003][#53003]
- Improved [`EXPLAIN`](../v20.2/explain.html) output for join nodes. [#53003][#53003]
- Improved [`EXPLAIN`](../v20.2/explain.html) output for scalar groups. [#53003][#53003]
- Improved [`EXPLAIN`](../v20.2/explain.html) output for set operations. [#53003][#53003]
- Box2d comparison operators are now gated by the [cluster setting](../v20.2/cluster-settings.html) `sql.spatial.experimental_box2d_comparison_operators.enabled`. [#52990][#52990]
- Implemented `ST_PointFromGeoHash`, which converts geohash to point. [#52892][#52892]
- Implemented the `ST_Extent` [builtin](../v20.2/functions-and-operators.html#built-in-functions) for `GEOMETRY` aggregations into box2d. [#53001][#53001]
- Added the `CONTROLJOB` role option. When creating/altering roles, `CONTROLJOB` can be passed as a role option. For example, [`CREATE USER <user> CONTROLJOB CREATEROLE`](../v20.2/create-user.html). `NOCONTROLJOB` can be used to remove `CONTROLJOB` from the role when altering the role. `CONTROLJOB` allows the user to pause/resume and cancel jobs owned by non-admin users. `CONTROLJOB` also allows seeing all jobs owned by non-admin users, i.e., when running [`SHOW JOBS`](../v20.2/show-jobs.html). [#52804][#52804]
- Implemented the geometry [builtin](../v20.2/functions-and-operators.html#built-in-functions) `ST_Dimension`. [#53068][#53068]
- Added a new public [cluster setting](../v20.2/cluster-settings.html) `sql.defaults.disallow_full_table_scans.enabled` that defaults to false, which informs the session setting `disallow_full_table_scans`. If the session is configured to disallow full table/index scans, any user query that plans a full table/index scan is rejected. This does not apply to internal queries or queries over virtual schemas (e.g., `pg_catalog`). [#52278][#52278]
- Renaming and dropping databases now satisfy the same transactional guarantees as online schema changes on tables: Changes will become visible if and only if the transaction commits, and a successful result indicates changes having propagated to the entire cluster. This fixes some long-standing problems with inconsistent database state being visible after renames and drops. (As a side effect of coherent caching for databases, database names can no longer be recycled in multiple schema changes in the same transaction.) [#52975][#52975]
- The [vectorized execution engine](../v20.2/vectorized-execution.html) now natively supports `DISTINCT` and `FILTER`ing hash aggregation. [#50721][#50721]
- Added support for `ALTER DATABASE OWNER TO`. This command changes the owner of a database. The user must be an owner of the database to run the command. The user must also be a member of the new owner role directly or indirectly. [#52736][#52736]
- [`UPSERT`](../v20.2/upsert.html) statements now acquire locks using the `FOR UPDATE` locking mode during their initial row scan, which improves performance for contended workloads. This behavior is configurable using the `enable_implicit_select_for_update` session variable and the `sql.defaults.implicit_select_for_update.enabled` [cluster setting](../v20.2/cluster-settings.html). [#53132][#53132]
- Users can now convert existing databases into schemas under other databases through the `ALTER DATABASE ... CONVERT TO SCHEMA UNDER PARENT ...` command. This command can only be run by `admin` and is only valid for databases that don't already have any child schemas other than `public`. [#52997][#52997]
- Implemented the `IdleInTransactionSessionTimeout` variable to allow terminating sessions that are idle in a transaction past the provided threshold. Set the variable by using `SET idle_in_transaction_session_timeout = 'time'`. Sessions that are idle in `OPEN`, `ABORTED`, and `DONE(COMMITWAIT)` transaction states will be terminated if the user idles longer than the threshold time. [#52938][#52938]
- Non-admin users with `CREATEROLE` are no longer permitted to drop users with the admin role. [#52881][#52881]
- Users can now specify which subdirectory they wish to write a [`BACKUP`](../v20.2/backup.html) to, via `BACKUP INTO 'subdir' IN x`. This will write `BACKUP` data to `x/subdir/`. [#53139][#53139]
- Implemented the geometry [builtin](../v20.2/functions-and-operators.html#built-in-functions) `ST_CoordDim` as an alias for `ST_NDims`. [#53193][#53193]
- Added support for `ALTER SCHEMA <schema> OWNER TO <owner>`. The command changes the owner of a schema. To use the conditions, the following conditions must be met: The user executing the command must be the of the schema. The user executing the command must be a member of the new owner role. The new owner role must have `CREATE` on the database the schema belongs to. [#52781][#52781]
- Implemented the geometry [builtins](../v20.2/functions-and-operators.html#built-in-functions) `ST_IsEmpty` and `ST_IsCollection`. [#53217][#53217]
- The [vectorized execution engine](../v20.2/vectorized-execution.html) now natively supports ordered aggregation with the `DISTINCT` clause. [#53145][#53145]
- Implemented the `ST_GeomFromGeoHash` and `ST_Box2DFromGeoHash` [builtins](../v20.2/functions-and-operators.html#built-in-functions). [#53162][#53162]
- Implemented the `ST_Union` [builtin](../v20.2/functions-and-operators.html#built-in-functions) as an aggregate. The previous alpha-available `ST_Union` for two arguments is deprecated. [#53127][#53127]
- Introduced a new `CONTROLCHANGEFEED` role option. This grants non-admin roles the ability to create new changefeeds, as long as they have `SELECT` privileges on the target table. It can be conferred via `ALTER ROLE <role> CONTROLCHANGEFEED` and revoked via `ALTER ROLE <role> NOCONTROLCHANGEFEED`. [#52869][#52869]
- Added support for `ALTER TYPE <type> OWNER TO <owner>`. The command changes the owner of a type. To use the conditions, the following conditions must be met: The user executing the command must be the owner of the type. The user executing the command must be a member of the new owner role. The new owner role must have `CREATE` on the schema the type belongs to. [#52656][#52656]
- Introduced a new `CREATEDB` role option. This grants non-admin roles the ability to create new databases. It can be conferred via `ALTER ROLE <role> CREATEDB` and revoked via `ALTER ROLE <role> NOCREATEDB`. [#52831][#52831]
- Schema owners can drop tables inside the schema without explicit `DROP` privilege on the table. [#52740][#52740]
- Queries logged in the [slow query log](../v20.2/query-behavior-troubleshooting.html#using-the-slow-query-log) come with a reason now, which can be any combination of `LATENCY_THRESHOLD`, `FULL_TABLE_SCAN`, and `FULL_SECONDORY_INDEX_SCAN`. There is also a new opt-in [cluster setting](../v20.2/cluster-settings.html) `sql.log.slow_query.experimental_full_table_scans.enabled` which, when enabled, logs full table/index scans regardless of the query execution being over the latency threshold. This setting only works if the slow query log has been turned on, i.e., a non-zero latency threshold must be specified. [#53164][#53164]
- Introduced a new `VIEWACTIVITY` role option. This grants non-admin roles the ability to see other users' sessions and queries through [`SHOW SESSIONS`](../v20.2/show-sessions.html), [`SHOW QUERIES`](../v20.2/show-queries.html), and the [Admin UI Statements page](../v20.2/admin-ui-statements-page.html). [#53291][#53291]
- Introduced a new `CANCELQUERY` role option. This grants non-admin roles the ability to cancel other users' queries and sessions. Note that non-admins are not allowed to cancel the queries or sessions of admins. [#53291][#53291]
- Implemented `ST_Expand` for `GEOMETRY`-based types. [#53326][#53326]
- Implemented the geometry [builtins](../v20.2/functions-and-operators.html#built-in-functions) `ST_Multi`, `ST_CollectionExtract`, and `ST_CollectionHomogenize`. [#53287][#53287]
- Previously, `selectivity` information would be included in [`EXPLAIN ANALYZE`](../v20.2/explain-analyze.html) diagrams if a query was executed via the [vectorized execution engine](../v20.2/vectorized-execution.html). This has been removed due to being confusing and probably unhelpful. [#53153][#53153]
- `stall time` has been renamed to `IO time` in [`EXPLAIN ANALYZE`](../v20.2/explain-analyze.html) diagrams for queries executed via the [vectorized execution engine](../v20.2/vectorized-execution.html). [#53153][#53153]
- Implemented geometry [builtin](../v20.2/functions-and-operators.html#built-in-functions) `ST_RemovePoint` [#53244][#53244]
- An [`INSERT ... ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE`](../v20.2/insert.html#on-conflict-clause) statement without a list of column names after `ON CONFLICT` now results in a SQL syntax error with the error code `42601`. Previously, it errored with the message "there is no unqiue or exlcusion constraint matching the ON CONFLICT specification" and the error code `42P10`. [#53067][#53067]
- Added support for the `WITH DATA` and `WITH NO DATA` arguments for the `REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW` command. [#53052][#53052]
- Added support for the `GRANT ... ON SCHEMA command`. [#53344][#53344]
- Added the `SHOW TYPES` command to list all user-defined types. [#53386][#53386]
- Implemented the `ST_IsClosed`, `ST_IsSimple`, and `ST_IsRing` [builtins](../v20.2/functions-and-operators.html#built-in-functions). [#53240][#53240]

### Command-line changes

- The --storage-engine CLI flag no longer defaults to using the last-used storage engine when unspecified. Instead, pebble is used by default unless otherwise specified using the --storage-engine flag. [#52944][#52944]
- Adds alias commands `ls` and `rm` for `userfile list` and `userfile delete`. [#53074][#53074]
- The new debug command `decode-proto` reads descriptor from stdin in hex or base64 format (auto-detected) and a flag --schema=<fully qualified name to decode> with default value `cockroach.sql.sqlbase.Descriptor` and outputs to stdout the deserialized proto in JSON format. If the input is not a hex/base64 encoded proto then it is outputted verbatim. [#52972][#52972]
- The `cockroach start` and `start-single-node` commands now enable `--redactable-logs` by default. It is also enabled by default in `cockroach demo` if `--log-dir` is passed. This causes log files to become redactable, so that `cockroach debug merge-log --redact` or `cockroach debug zip --redact` can remove sensitive information out of log files. (Reminder: `cockroach debug zip --redact` only affects *log files*; other items collected by the command can still contain sensitive information) [#53263][#53263]
- The command-line flag `--socket` has been removed. It was deprecated since v20.1. Use `--socket-dir` in replacement. [#53405][#53405]
- The command-line `--insecure` has been marked as deprecated. See https://go.crdb.dev/issue/53404 for details. The flag will be removed in a later version in a staged fashion: first, additional security mechanisms will be added to enable more flexible deployments which were previously done using `--insecure`; then the flaf will be removed from server commands, then finally in a later version also from client commands. [#53405][#53405]
- Recognize the \dT alias for listing user defined [types](../v20.2/data-types.html). [#53386][#53386]

### Admin UI changes

- Improved how [SQL statement plans](../v20.2/admin-ui-statements-page.html#logical-plan) in the Admin UI are populated, using the new `EXPLAIN` infrastructure. [#52956][#52956]

### Bug fixes

- Fixed a bug for [`ALTER TABLE`](../v20.2/alter-table.html) statements with multiple actions. In certain cases if the last action had no effect, the entire statement would be treated as a no-op. [#52819][#52819]
- Previously, unexpected context cancellation errors could sometimes be returned in the [vectorized execution engine](../v20.2/vectorized-execution.html). This is now fixed. [#52463][#52463]
- Fixed a bug where tables would not be cleaned up after a failed creation through [`CREATE TABLE AS`](../v20.2/create-table-as.html). [#52832][#52832]
- Fixed a bug whereby gc jobs for tables dropped as part of a [`DROP DATABASE CASCADE`](../v20.2/drop-database.html) might never complete. [#52818][#52818]
- Fixed an internal error that could occur when using an index-accelerated geospatial function inside an `EXISTS` or `NOT EXISTS` correlated subquery. [#52942][#52942]
- Fixed a bug where if a table with a check constraint was truncated while being backfilled, the check constraint could get lost. [#49399][#49399]
- Fixed bug where non-committed `DETACHED BACKUPS` left files which falsely indicated that a [`BACKUP`](../v20.2/backup.html) was in progress. [#52980][#52980]
- Fixed a crash that could occur when referencing a database that did not exist when trying to create a type or sequence, or when renaming a table. [#53137][#53137]
- Eliminated some rare `AmbiguousCommitErrors` happening when [CDC](../v20.2/change-data-capture.html) was used. [#53146][#53146]
- A change in v20.1 caused a certain class of bulk [`UPDATE`](../v20.2/update.html) and [`DELETE`](../v20.2/delete.html) statements to hang indefinitely if run in an implicit transaction. We now break up these statements to avoid starvation and prevent them from hanging indefinitely. [#52885][#52885]
- Previously, cluster restores would appear in the [jobs table](../v20.2/show-jobs.html) and [Admin UI Jobs page](../v20.2/admin-ui-jobs-page.html) as `RESTORE TABLE FROM ...`, which was incorrect. They now appear as `RESTORE FROM ...`. [#53230][#53230]
- Previously, CockroachDB could return incorrect results when performing `LEFT ANTI` hash joins when right equality columns would form a key when using the [vectorized execution engine](../v20.2/vectorized-execution.html). This has been fixed. [#53226][#53226]
- Admin users are now permitted to cancel other users' queries and sessions. Previously only the root user was allowed to do so. [#53291][#53291]

### Performance improvements

- Maximum and minimum values, represented as 2-bucket histograms, are now collected for all non-index columns (up to 100 columns per table) as part of automatic statistics collection. 200-bucket histograrms are still collected for all index columns. This change enables the [optimizer](../v20.2/cost-based-optimizer.html) to make better cardinality estimates and may result in better query plans in some cases. [#52905][#52905]
- A large heap allocation performed during [`INSERT`](../v20.2/insert.html) statements was removed, resulting in an increase to throughput for single-row `INSERT` statements. [#53076][#53076]
- Transient node liveness blips no longer cause up-to-date ranges to unquiesce, which makes these events less destabilizing. [#51894][#51894]
- The `~` and `&&` geospatial bounding box operations can now benefit from index acceleration if one of the operands is an indexed geometry column. [#53023][#53023]
- Cleaning up after a failure during [`IMPORT INTO`](../v20.2/import-into.html) a table which was empty is now faster. [#52754][#52754]
- The allocation algorithm now supports intra-node rebalances, which means CockroachDB can fully utilize the additional stores on the same node. This removes the last roadblock to running CockroachDB with multiple stores (i.e., disks) per node. [#51567][#51567]
- Validation of optimistic reads is now performed earlier in transactions when doing so can save work. This eliminates certain types of [transaction retry errors](../v20.2/transaction-retry-error-reference.html) and avoids wasted RPC traffic. [#52884][#52884]
- Fixes a performance regression introduced in 20.2 alpha releases where the use of 2-part names to specify tables or types would incur extra reads from the store on every transaction. [#53290][#53290]
- The optimizer can now convert semi joins to inner joins in more cases, which may allow the optimizer to produce more efficient query plans. [#53337][#53337]
